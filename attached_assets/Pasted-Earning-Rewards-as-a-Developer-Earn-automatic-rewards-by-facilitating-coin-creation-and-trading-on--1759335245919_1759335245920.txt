Earning Rewards as a Developer
Earn automatic rewards by facilitating coin creation and trading on the Zora Coins Protocol. Developers can earn from both creating coins and facilitating trades, with rewards distributed automatically in the backing currency.

SDK Integration
For the easiest implementation, use the Zora SDK:

Creating Coins - SDK guide for coin creation with referrals
Trading Coins - SDK guide for trading with referrals
Reward Types and Distribution
There are two types of referral rewards available to developers:

Platform Referral Rewards
Set once during coin creation
Earns from all future trades for the coin's entire lifespan
Sticky - permanently associated with the coin
Trade Referral Rewards
Set per individual swap
Earns only from that specific trade
Can be different for each transaction
Reward Percentages
For detailed reward percentages and distribution breakdown, see Coin Rewards.
Both Content Coins and Creator Coins now offer the same referral reward structure (as of version 2.2.0):

Platform Referral: 20% of total fees (25% of market rewards)
Trade Referral: 4% of total fees (5% of market rewards)
This unified structure means developers can earn referral rewards from both coin types.

Technical Implementation
Platform Referral Setup
Set the platformReferrer parameter when creating coins to earn from all future trades. This address is permanently set for the coin's entire lifespan:


// Deploy a Content Coin with create referral
address coin = factory.deploy(
    payoutRecipient,         
    owners,                  
    uri,                     
    name,                    
    symbol,                  
    poolConfig,              
    YOUR_PLATFORM_ADDRESS,   // üéØ This address earns platform referral rewards
    postDeployHook,          
    postDeployHookData,      
    coinSalt                 
);
Trade Referral Setup
Include your address in the hookData parameter when facilitating swaps. Unlike create referrals, trade referrals are set on a per-swap basis.

Building Hook Data
When executing swaps through Uniswap V4, encode your platform address as the hook data:


// Encode your platform address as hookData
bytes memory hookData = abi.encode(YOUR_PLATFORM_ADDRESS);
This hookData should be included in your swap parameters when calling the Uniswap V4 router. The hook data tells the Zora Coins hook which address should receive trade referral rewards for that specific swap.

How Rewards Work
Automatic Distribution: Rewards are distributed automatically on every swap - no manual claiming required
Multi-Hop Conversion: All rewards are automatically converted to the backing currency (typically ZORA) before distribution
Immediate Payout: Rewards are sent directly to recipient addresses with each trade
For complete information about reward distribution, fee structures, and economics, see Coin Rewards.

Ran deployment script

Executed node scripts/deploy-registry.js

Decided on deployment threshold
The new wallet has 0.000470 ETH, which should be enough for deployment on Base (gas is very low). Let me adjust the minimum requirement and deploy:


Decided on contract deployment address
ðŸŽ‰ Contract deployed successfully!

Contract Address: 0xa99d508b3d5f9e9bf4b18396250974e684529668

View on Basescan: https://basescan.org/address/0xa99d508b3d5f9e9bf4b18396250974e684529668

The YoubuidlChannelsRegistry is now live on Base Mainnet! Now you need to add the contract address to your Replit Secrets so your backend can interact with it:

Add this secret:

Key: REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
Value: 0xa99d508b3d5f9e9bf4b18396250974e684529668
You'll also need to set PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY for batch registration (this can be the same wallet as your deployer, or a different one). Let me know once you've added these secrets and I'll help you test the registry integration!

veify with hardhat

Decided on Hardhat verification approach
I'll set up Hardhat verification for the contract. Let me reinstall Hardhat with the verify plugin:


Installed hardhat, @nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify

Decided on Hardhat config structure

Created hardhat.config.cjs

Planned contract verification process

Executed npx hardhat verify --network base 0xa99d508b3d5f9e9bf4b18396250974e684529668

Decided on config file path

Executed npx hardhat verify --config hardhat.config.cjs --network base 0xa99d508b3d5f9e9bf4b18396250974e684529668

Decided on Hardhat config fix

Edited hardhat.config.cjs

Decided on adding type field

Executed npx hardhat verify --config hardhat.config.cjs --network base 0xa99d508b3d5f9e9bf4b18396250974e684529668

Decided on contract verification method (6 seconds)
Hardhat is having compatibility issues with Node.js 20. Let me create a simple curl-based verification script instead:


Decided on manual verification approach (5 seconds)
The Basescan API is experiencing issues with their V2 migration across all verification methods. The most reliable way to verify your contract right now is through their web interface.

Here's the quickest way to verify:
